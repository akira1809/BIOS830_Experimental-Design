# BIOS830_Experimental-Design <br />

This project presents practices I have done on the Experimental Design class.<br />
There are five homework assignments, and one small project of writing up a proposal in the NIH style.<br />
The textbook is "Design and Analysis of Experiments" by Angela Dean and Dabuel Voss.<br />
